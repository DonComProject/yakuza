# Yakuza Project

1. `yakuza.py`: This is the main file of the application. It contains the main logic of the program and is the entry point when you run the application.

2. `imports.py`: This file contains all the import statements used in the application. It's a way to centralize all the dependencies the application has.

3. `defs.py`: This file contains definitions of functions and classes used in the application. It's a way to organize the code by separating the definitions from the main logic.

4. `constants.py`: This file contains constant values that are used throughout the application. By defining them in one place, you can easily change them if needed without having to search through the entire codebase.

5. `files.py`
